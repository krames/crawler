# Crawler

This project was an experiment to play with the [task concurrency pattern](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/topics/concurrency_patterns/task). 

It does not contain tests and should **NOT** be considered production quality code.

To build:

```
go build -o crawler 
```
